            </h2>
            <p>

                For each subscription you order on the Site, you agree to pay the price applicable for the Product as of the time you submitted your order (“Product Price”), the delivery fees for the delivery service you select (“Delivery Fees”), and any applicable Taxes (defined below). If you order a subscription to a Product (with a monthly term, or a term of 3 months, 6 months or 12 months) that auto-renews (“Subscription”), then you agree to pay the applicable Product Price, Delivery Fees, and Taxes upon each auto-renewal date, until you terminate your Subscription in accordance with the directions on the Site. Your next billing date will be displayed in your Account page for each of your active Subscriptions (“Renews on” date). We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, there are unforeseen delays that hinder our ability to ship your product, or there are changes to your account or Subscriptions. Please also note that if your Subscription includes a discounted Product Price for a promotional period, once the promotional period expires, your Subscription will renew at the full Product Price. As such, if you purchase a Subscription, until such time as you terminate your Subscription in accordance with the directions on this site, you hereby authorize, agree and assent to the Company automatically billing your credit card submitted as part of the order process for such amounts that are due. You will be solely responsible for payment of all taxes (other than taxes based on Company’s income), fees, duties, and other governmental charges, and any related penalties and interest, arising from the Product purchase (“Taxes”) not withheld by Company, including, without limitation, all Product purchased pursuant to any Updated Subscription. All payments are non-refundable (except as expressly set forth in this document). Without limiting other remedies, we reserve the right to charge a late fee on all past due payments equivalent to the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance or the highest rate allowed by law. You agree to pay for all collection costs, attorneys’ fees, and court costs incurred in the collection of past due amounts.
